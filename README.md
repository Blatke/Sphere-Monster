In Studio, search for "sphere monster" in QuickAccessBox and add it in the scene.

Enable the adv.mode of HS2PE / AIPE, on the tab of Bones, there are two categories of bones to manipulate:
1. The bones prefixed by "C", which are the ones mainly controles the rotation (as well as position) for the monster's poses. Each bone is linked with one another, so when a parent such as "C1" is transforming (moving, rotating or scaling), its children C2, C3, C4 and C5 will follow it.
